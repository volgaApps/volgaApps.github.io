        <div class="subtitle" style="white-space:pre-wrap">I Am the Last… is a dark, atmospheric survival shooter focused on story and immersion.
After the use of an unknown weapon, soldiers and civilians lost their humanity. They still walk the streets, still hold weapons, still shoot — but without purpose, memory, or reason. The city remains standing, yet life has vanished from it.
The player is the only one who remembers what it means to be human. A diary becomes his last connection to reality — a silent companion that helps him endure fear, loneliness, and the slow erosion of hope. Each entry reflects his thoughts, doubts, and the growing weight of isolation.
This is not a game about victory or saving the world.
It is about moving forward through ruins and silence, surrounded by infected enemies, searching not for answers — but for any sign that someone else is still alive.
Survive, fight, and read the diary of the last human in a world that has already ended.</div>
